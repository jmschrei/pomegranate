    "## Hidden Markov Models\n",

    "\n",
    "Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are the flagship of the pomegranate package in that\n",
    "they have the most features of all of the models and that they were the first\n",
    "algorithm implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hidden Markov models are a form of structured prediction\n",
    "method that are popular for tagging all elements in a sequence with some\n",
    "\"hidden\" state. They can be thought of as extensions of Markov chains where,\n",
    "instead of the probability of the next observation being dependant on the\n",
    "current observation, the probability of the next **hidden state** is dependant\n",
    "on the current hidden state, and the next observation is derived from that\n",
    "hidden state. An example of this can be part of speech tagging, where the\n",
    "observations are words and the hidden states are parts of speech. Each word gets\n",
    "tagged with a part of speech, but dynamic programming is utilized to search\n",
    "through all potential word-tag combinations to identify the best set of tags\n",
    "across the entire sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another perspective of HMMs is that they are an\n",
    "extension on mixture models that includes a transition matrix. Conceptually, a\n",
    "mixture model has a set of \"hidden\" states---the mixture components---and one\n",
    "can calculate the probability that each sample belongs to each component. This\n",
    "approach treats each observations independently. However, like in the part-of-\n",
    "speech example we know that an adjective typically is followed by a noun, and so\n",
    "position in the sequence matters. A HMM adds a transition matrix between the\n",
    "hidden states to incorporate this information across the sequence, allowing for\n",
    "higher probabilities of transitioning from the \"adjective\" hidden state to a\n",
    "noun or verb.\n",
    "\n",
    "pomegranate implements HMMs in a flexible manner that goes beyond\n",
    "what other packages allow. Let's see some examples."

    "The issue with identifying these regions is that they are not exclusively made\n",

    "HMM is used to align a sequence to a reference 'profile', where the reference\n",
    "profile can either be a single sequence, or an alignment of many sequences (such\n",
    "as a reference genome). In essence, this profile has a 'match' state for every\n",
    "position in the reference profile, and 'insert' state, and a 'delete' state. The\n",
    "insert state allows the external sequence to have an insertion into the sequence\n",
    "without throwing off the entire alignment, such as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`ACCG :\n",
    "Sequence` <br>\n",
    "`|| |` <br>\n",
    "`AC-G : Reference`\n",
    "\n",
    "or a deletion, which is the\n",
    "opposite:\n",
    "\n",
    "`A-G : Sequence` <br>\n",
    "`| |` <br>\n",
    "`ACG : Reference`\n",
    "\n",
    "The bars in the\n",
    "middle refer to a perfect match, whereas the lack of a bar means either a\n",
    "deletion/insertion, or a mismatch. A mismatch is where two positions are aligned\n",
    "together, but do not match. This models the biological phenomena of mutation,\n",
    "where one nucleotide can convert to another over time. It is usually more likely\n",
    "in biological sequences that this type of mutation occurs than that the\n",
    "nucleotide was deleted from the sequence (shifting all nucleotides over by one)\n",
    "and then another was inserted at the exact location (moving all nucleotides over\n",
    "again). Since we are using a probabilistic model, we get to define these\n",
    "probabilities through the use of distributions! If we want to model mismatches,\n",
    "we can just set our 'match' state to have an appropriate distribution with non-\n",
    "zero probabilities over mismatches. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets now create a three nucleotide profile\n",
    "HMM, which models the sequence 'ACT'. We will fuzz this a little bit in the\n",
    "match states, pretending to have some prior information about what mutations\n",
    "occur at each position. If you don't have any information, setting a uniform,\n",
