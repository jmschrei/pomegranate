    "The majority of machine learning algorithms assume that they are operating on a\n",
    "fully observed data set. In contast, a great deal of data sets in the real world\n",
    "are missing some values. Sometimes, this missingness is missing at random (MAR),\n",
    "which means that there is no important pattern to the missingness, and sometimes\n",
    "the missingness itself can be interpreted as a feature. For example, in the\n",
    "Titanic data set, males were more likely to have missing records than females\n",
    "were, and those without children were more likely to have missing records. \n",
    "\n",
    "A\n",
    "common approach to bridging this gap is to impute the missing values and then\n",
    "treat the entire data set as observed. For continuous features this is commonly\n",
    "done by replacing the missing values with the mean or median of the column. For\n",
    "categorical variables it is commonly done by replacing the missing values with\n",
    "the most common category observed in that column. While these techniques are\n",
    "simple and allow for almost any ML algorithm to be run, they are frequently\n",
    "suboptimal. Consider the follow simple example of continuous data that is\n",
