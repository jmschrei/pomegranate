    "Bayesian networks are a general-purpose probabilistic model that are a superset of all others presented in pomegranate. Specifically, Bayesian networks are a way of factorizing a joint probability distribution across a graph structure, where the presence of an edge represents a directed dependency between two variables and the lack of an edge represents a conditional independence. Importantly, the lack of an edge does not represent true independence of two variables by itself, but a conditional independence."

    "Perhaps the most useful application of a learned Bayesian network is the ability to do inference for missing values. Rather than a traditional prediction problem, which has a fixed set of inputs and one or more fixed outputs, Bayesian network inference will use any variables whose values are known to infer any variables whose values are not known. The set of known variables can change across examples, and so do not need to be known in advance.\n",

    "In pomegranate, this is done using the loopy belief propogation algorithm, sometimes also called the \"sum-product\" algorithm. This algorithm is run on a factor graph, which is constructed in the backend. The trade-offs for this, versus normal junction-tree inference, are that the algorithm is faster, easier to implement, exact for tree-like Bayesian networks, and can provide estimates even for cyclic networks, but that the inference is not guaranteed to be exact in other cases or even to converge when the network is cyclic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of the prediction methods differs slightly from other models in pomegranate. First, the unobserved variables are indicated using a `torch.masked.MaskedTensor` object, which holds the underlying data and a mask where `True` means the value is observed and `False` means that it is not observed. When the mask is `False`, it does not matter what the underlying value is. "
