    "Hidden Markov models are a form of structured prediction method which extend general mixture models to sequences of data, where position in the sequence is relevant. If each point in this sequence is completely independent of the other points, then HMMs are not the right tools and GMMs (or more complicated Bayesian networks) may be a better tool.\n",

    "Lets take the simplified example of CG island detection on a sequence of DNA. DNA is made up of the four canonical nucleotides, abbreviated 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. Specific organizations of these nucleotides encode enough information to build you, a human being. One simple region in the genome is called the 'CG' island, where the nucleotides 'C' and 'G' are enriched. Lets compare the predictions of a GMM with the predictions of a HMM, to both understand conceptually the differences between the two, and to see how easy it is to use pomegranate."

We know that CG islands have some As and Ts in them, and background sequence has Cs and Gs. We can change the transition probabilities to account for this, and prevent switching from occuring too rapidly."

However, the third (or fourth, depending on ordering) row is the transitions from the start state, and it only slightly favors the background state.

A profile HMM is used to align a sequence to a reference 'profile', where the reference profile can either be a single sequence, or an alignment of many sequences (such as a reference genome). In essence, this profile has a 'match' state for every position in the reference profile, and 'insert' state, and a 'delete' state. The insert state allows the external sequence to have an insertion into the sequence without throwing off the entire alignment, such as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`ACCG : Sequence` <br>\n",
    "`|| |` <br>\n",
    "`AC-G : Reference`\n",
    "\n",
    "or a deletion, which is the opposite:\n",
    "\n",
    "`A-G : Sequence` <br>\n",
    "`| |` <br>\n",
    "`ACG : Reference`\n",
    "\n",
    "The bars in the middle refer to a perfect match, whereas the lack of a bar means either a deletion/insertion, or a mismatch. A mismatch is where two positions are aligned together, but do not match. This models the biological phenomena of mutation, where one nucleotide can convert to another over time. It is usually more likely in biological sequences that this type of mutation occurs than that the nucleotide was deleted from the sequence (shifting all nucleotides over by one) and then another was inserted at the exact location (moving all nucleotides over again). Since we are using a probabilistic model, we get to define these probabilities through the use of distributions! If we want to model mismatches, we can just set our 'match' state to have an appropriate distribution with non-zero probabilities over mismatches. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets now create a three nucleotide profile HMM, which models the sequence 'ACT'. We will fuzz this a little bit in the match states, pretending to have some prior information about what mutations occur at each position. If you don't have any information, setting a uniform, small, value over the other values is usually okay."

    "There are two main algorithms for training hidden Markov models-- Baum Welch (structured version of Expectation Maximization), and Viterbi training. Since we don't start off with labels on the data, these are both unsupervised training algorithms. In order to assign labels, Baum Welch uses EM to assign soft labels (weights in this case) to each point belonging to each state, and then using weighted MLE estimates to update the distributions. Viterbi assigns hard labels to each observation using the Viterbi algorithm, and then updates the distributions based on these hard labels.\n",

    "Sometimes we want to say that multiple states model the same phenomena, but are simply at different points in the graph because we are utilizing complicated edge structure. An example is in the example of the global alignment HMM we saw. All insert states represent the same phenomena, which is nature randomly inserting a nucleotide, and this probability should be the same regardless of position. However, we can't simply have a single insert state, or we'd be allowed to transition from any match state to any other match state.\n",

An example might be a complicated profile HMM, where you don't expect to see deletes or inserts at all in your training data, but don't want to change from the default values.\n",

    "Since pomegranate is implemented in cython, the majority of functions are written with the GIL released. A benefit of doing this is that we can use multithreading in order to make some computationally intensive tasks take less time. However, a downside is that python doesn't play nicely with multithreading, and so there are some cases where training using multithreading can make your model training take significantly longer. I investigate this in an early multithreading pull request <a href=\"https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate/pull/30\">here</a>. Things have improved since then, but the gist is that if you have a small model (less than 15 states), it may be detrimental, but the larger your model is, the more it scales towards getting a speed improvement exactly the number of threads you use. You can specify multithreading using the `n_jobs` keyword. All structures in pomegranate are thread safe, so you don't need to worry about race conditions."
