    "Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are the flagship of the pomegranate package in that they have the most features of all of the models and that they were the first algorithm implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hidden Markov models are a form of structured prediction method that are popular for tagging all elements in a sequence with some \"hidden\" state. They can be thought of as extensions of Markov chains where, instead of the probability of the next observation being dependant on the current observation, the probability of the next **hidden state** is dependant on the current hidden state, and the next observation is derived from that hidden state. An example of this can be part of speech tagging, where the observations are words and the hidden states are parts of speech. Each word gets tagged with a part of speech, but dynamic programming is utilized to search through all potential word-tag combinations to identify the best set of tags across the entire sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another perspective of HMMs is that they are an extension on mixture models that includes a transition matrix. Conceptually, a mixture model has a set of \"hidden\" states---the mixture components---and one can calculate the probability that each sample belongs to each component. This approach treats each observations independently. However, like in the part-of-speech example we know that an adjective typically is followed by a noun, and so position in the sequence matters. A HMM adds a transition matrix between the hidden states to incorporate this information across the sequence, allowing for higher probabilities of transitioning from the \"adjective\" hidden state to a noun or verb.\n",

    "\n",
    "Lets take the simplified example of CG island detection on a sequence of DNA. DNA is made up of the four canonical nucleotides, abbreviated 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. We can say that regions of the genome that are enriched for nucleotides 'C' and 'G' are 'CG islands', which is a simplification of the real biological concept but sufficient for our example. The issue with identifying these regions is that they are not exclusively made up of the nucleotides 'C' and 'G', but have some 'A's and 'T's scatted amongst them. A simple model that looked for long stretches of C's and G's would not perform well, because it would miss most of the real regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can start off by building the model. Because HMMs involve the transition matrix, which is often represented using a graph over the hidden states, building them requires a few more steps that a simple distribution or the mixture model. Our simple model will be composed of two distributions. One distribution wil be a uniform distribution across all four characters and one will have a preference for the nucleotides C and G, while still allowing the nucleotides A and T to be present."

The predicted integers don't correspond to the order in which states were added to the model, but rather, the order that they exist in the model after a topological sort. More importantly, the model wasn't tricked into thinking that every CG or even pair of CGs was an island.

Naturally, the balance of the transition and emission probabilities will heavily influence what regions are detected.\n",

It is a square matrix of size equal to the number of states (including start and end state), with number of transitions from (row_id) to (column_id). This is exemplified by the 1.0 in the first row, indicating that there is one transition from background state to the end state, as that's the only way to reach the end state. However, the third (or fourth, depending on ordering) row is the transitions from the start state, and it only slightly favors the background state. These counts are not normalized to the length of the input sequence, but can easily be done so by dividing by row sums, column sums, or entire table sums, depending on your application.\n",

This could be used to infer that there are ~2-3 edges, which makes sense if you consider that the start and end of the sequence seem like they might be part of the CG island states except for the strict transition probabilities used (look at the first few rows of the emission table above.)"

A profile HMM is used to align a sequence to a reference 'profile', where the reference profile can either be a single sequence, or an alignment of many sequences (such as a reference genome). In essence, this profile has a 'match' state for every position in the reference profile, and 'insert' state, and a 'delete' state. The insert state allows the external sequence to have an insertion into the sequence without throwing off the entire alignment, such as the following:\n",

It is usually more likely in biological sequences that this type of mutation occurs than that the nucleotide was deleted from the sequence (shifting all nucleotides over by one) and then another was inserted at the exact location (moving all nucleotides over again). Since we are using a probabilistic model, we get to define these probabilities through the use of distributions! If we want to model mismatches, we can just set our 'match' state to have an appropriate distribution with non-zero probabilities over mismatches. \n",

Viterbi assigns hard labels to each observation using the Viterbi algorithm, and then updates the distributions based on these hard labels.\n",

    "Since pomegranate is implemented in cython, the majority of functions are written with the GIL released. A benefit of doing this is that we can use multithreading in order to make some computationally intensive tasks take less time. However, a downside is that python doesn't play nicely with multithreading, and so there are some cases where training using multithreading can make your model training take significantly longer. I investigate this in an early multithreading pull request <a href=\"https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate/pull/30\">here</a>. Things have improved since then, but the gist is that if you have a small model (less than 15 states), it may be detrimental, but the larger your model is, the more it scales towards getting a speed improvement exactly the number of threads you use. You can specify multithreading using the `n_jobs` keyword. All structures in pomegranate are thread safe, so you don't need to worry about race conditions."

Lets look at the original CG island model, since it's significantly smaller."
