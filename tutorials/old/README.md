# Tutorial

This tutorial covers both the concept of probabilistic modelling, and how to do such using pomegranate. The tutorials show probabilistic models of increasing complexity, with a single distribution being the simplest, and a Bayesian network being the most sophisticated. 

To read a tutorial, just click on the notebook above. Github can render IPython notebooks natively, so you don't need to go through the complicated procedure of rendering them somewhere else.
