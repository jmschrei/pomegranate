**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is, including what you were expecting to happen and what actually happened. Please report the version of pomegranate that you are using and the operating system. Also, please make sure that you have upgraded to the latest version of pomegranate before submitting the bug report.

**To Reproduce**
Please provide a snippet of code that can reproduce this error. It is much easier for us to track down bugs and fix them if we have an example script that fails until we're successful.

**Response time**
Although I will likely respond during weekdays if I am not on vacation, I am not likely to be able to merge PRs or write code until the weekend.
