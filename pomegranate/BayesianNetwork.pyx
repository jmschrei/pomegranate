		"""Learn the structure of the network from data.

		Find the structure of the network from data using a Bayesian structure
		learning score. This currently enumerates all the exponential number of
		structures and finds the best according to the score. This allows
		weights on the different samples as well. The score that is optimized
		is the minimum description length (MDL).

		Parameters
		----------
		X : array-like, shape (n_samples, n_nodes)
			The data to fit the structure too, where each row is a sample and
			each column corresponds to the associated variable.

		weights : array-like, shape (n_nodes), optional
			The weight of each sample as a positive double. Default is None.

		algorithm : str, one of 'chow-liu', 'greedy', 'exact', 'exact-dp' optional
			The algorithm to use for learning the Bayesian network. Default is
			'greedy' that greedily attempts to find the best structure, and
			frequently can identify the optimal structure. 'exact' uses DP/A* 
			to find the optimal Bayesian network, and 'exact-dp' tries to find
			the shortest path on the entire order lattice, which is more memory
			and computationally expensive. 'exact' and 'exact-dp' should give
			identical results, with 'exact-dp' remaining an option mostly for
			debugging reasons. 'chow-liu' will return the optimal tree-like
			structure for the Bayesian network, which is a very fast
			approximation but not always the best network.

		max_parents : int, optional
			The maximum number of parents a node can have. If used, this means
			using the k-learn procedure. Can drastically speed up algorithms.
			If -1, no max on parents. Default is -1.

		root : int, optional
			For algorithms which require a single root ('chow-liu'), this is the
			root for which all edges point away from. User may specify which
			column to use as the root. Default is the first column.

		constraint_graph : networkx.DiGraph or None, optional
			A directed graph showing valid parent sets for each variable. Each
			node is a set of variables, and edges represent which variables can
			be valid parents of those variables. The naive structure learning
			task is just all variables in a single node with a self edge,
			meaning that you know nothing about

		pseudocount : double, optional
			A pseudocount to add to the emission of each distribution. This
			effectively smoothes the states to prevent 0. probability symbols
			if they don't happen to occur in the data. Default is 0.

		state_names : array-like, shape (n_nodes), optional
			A list of meaningful names to be applied to nodes

		name : str, optional
			The name of the model. Default is None.

		reduce_dataset : bool, optional
			Given the discrete nature of these datasets, frequently a user
			will pass in a dataset that has many identical samples. It is time
			consuming to go through these redundant samples and a far more
			efficient use of time to simply calculate a new dataset comprised
			of the subset of unique observed samples weighted by the number of 
			times they occur in the dataset. This typically will speed up all
			algorithms, including when using a constraint graph. Default is 
			True.

		n_jobs : int, optional
			The number of threads to use when learning the structure of the
			network. If a constraint graph is provided, this will parallelize
			the tasks as directed by the constraint graph. If one is not
			provided it will parallelize the building of the parent graphs.
			Both cases will provide large speed gains.

		model : BayesianNetwork
			The learned BayesianNetwork.

	Generate a parent graph for a single variable over its parents.

	This will generate the parent graph for a single parents given the data.
	A parent graph is the dynamically generated best parent set and respective

	generating a parent graph for x1 over x2, x3, and x4, we may calculate that
	having x2 as a parent is better than x2,x3 and so store the value
	of x2 in the node for x2,x3.

	X : numpy.ndarray, shape=(n, d)
		The data to fit the structure too, where each row is a sample and

	weights : numpy.ndarray, shape=(n,)
		The weight of each sample as a positive double. Default is None.

	key_count : numpy.ndarray, shape=(d,)
		The number of unique keys in each column.

	pseudocount : double
		A pseudocount to add to each possibility.

	max_parents : int

		If -1, no max on parents. Default is -1.

	parent_set : tuple, default ()
		The variables which are possible parents for this variable. If nothing

		expect in the naive case. This allows for cases where we want to build
		a parent graph over only a subset of the variables.

	"""
	Find the optimal graph in a node with a Self Loop And Parents (SLAP).

	Instead of just performing exact BNSL over the set of all parents and
	removing the offending edges there are efficiencies that can be gained
	by considering the structure. In particular, parents not coming from the
	main node do not need to be considered in the order graph but simply
	added to each entry after creation of the order graph. This is because
	those variables occur earlier in the topological ordering but it doesn't
	matter how they occur otherwise. Parent graphs must be defined over all
	variables however.

	Parameters
	----------
	X : numpy.ndarray, shape=(n, d)
		The data to fit the structure too, where each row is a sample and
		each column corresponds to the associated variable.

	weights : numpy.ndarray, shape=(n,)
		The weight of each sample as a positive double. Default is None.

	key_count : numpy.ndarray, shape=(d,)
		The number of unique keys in each column.

	pseudocount : double
		A pseudocount to add to each possibility.

	max_parents : int
		The maximum number of parents a node can have. If used, this means
		using the k-learn procedure. Can drastically speed up algorithms.
		If -1, no max on parents. Default is -1.

	n_jobs : int
		The number of threads to use when learning the structure of the
		network. This parallelizes the creation of the parent graphs.

	structure : tuple, shape=(d,)
		The parents for each variable in this SCC

	The general algorithm in this case is to begin with each variable and add

	"""
	Generate a parent graph for a single variable over its parents.

	This will generate the parent graph for a single parents given the data.
	A parent graph is the dynamically generated best parent set and respective
	score for each combination of parent variables. For example, if we are
	generating a parent graph for x1 over x2, x3, and x4, we may calculate that
	having x2 as a parent is better than x2,x3 and so store the value
	of x2 in the node for x2,x3. 

	Parameters
	----------
	X : numpy.ndarray, shape=(n, d)
		The data to fit the structure too, where each row is a sample and
		each column corresponds to the associated variable.

	weights : numpy.ndarray, shape=(n,)
		The weight of each sample as a positive double. Default is None.

	key_count : numpy.ndarray, shape=(d,)
		The number of unique keys in each column.

	pseudocount : double
		A pseudocount to add to each possibility.

	max_parents : int
		The maximum number of parents a node can have. If used, this means
		using the k-learn procedure. Can drastically speed up algorithms.
		If -1, no max on parents. Default is -1.

	parent_set : tuple, default ()
		The variables which are possible parents for this variable. If nothing
		is passed in then it defaults to all other variables, as one would
		expect in the naive case. This allows for cases where we want to build
		a parent graph over only a subset of the variables.
