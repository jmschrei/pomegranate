		algorithm: : str, one of 'gibbs', 'rejection' optional. default 'rejection'
			Rejection sampling successively sample each node given its parents evidence. When evidences are given on
			non-root nodes, only draws that are compatible with evidence nodes are not rejected. Rejection sampling is a good
			option when evidences nodes are not far from the root nodes or when given evidence is likely. Rare evidences
			lead to a high rate of rejected samples, thus to significant slow down of the sampling.
			Gibbs sampling scheme is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique designed to speed up the sampling. It
			builds conditional probability of state transition of each nodes given its neighbours in its markov blanket.
			Works well with a lot of evidences in the network, even when they are far from the root nodes. Drawback :
			convergence is only guaranteed when there is a non null probability path between states. If the posterior
			consists of isolated islands of high probability, Gibbs sampling will stay stuck in one the island
			and will never transition to the others. Successive samples will have high correlation.

		min_prob : float <1 optional. If algorithm == "rejection"
			stop iterations when  Sum P(X|Evidence) < min_prob. generated samples for a given evidence will be
			incomplete (<n)

		initial_state : dict, optional

			Default is to use the maximum joint-probability values, calculated with self.predict().
			The default should be optimal.

		scan_order: str, one 'topological','random' optional. If algorithm == "gibbs"
			Scan order or the gibbs sampler. Indicate in which order nodes are sampled. Topological order is good for
			chain like networks (lots of successive nodes). Random order yield better results with more connected

		There are currently two types of approaches implemented. The first,
		the Chow-Liu algorithm, finds a tree-like structure from symmetric
		mutual-information scores given a root node (the `root` parameter).
		The second type searches through structures and returns the structure
		that maximizes the following objective function:

			P(D|M) + penalty * |M|

		where P(D|M) is the probability of the data given the found model,
		penalty is a user-specified parameters, and |M| is the number of
		parameters in the model. When this penalty is log2(|D|) / 2
		(the default) where |D| is the weight sum of the examples, this is
		equivalent to the minimum description length (MDL).

		There are currently three ways that the learned structure can be
		controlled. The first is to increase the penalty term to increase
		sparsity. The second is to pass in a specified list of edges that
		must exist (`include_edges`) or cannot exist (`exclude_edges`). Lastly,
		a constraint graph can be specified where each node in the graph is a
		set of variables being modeled and the edges in the graph indicate
		which sets of variables can be parents to which other sets of
		variables (and where a self-loop is the normal structure learning step).

		Parameters
		----------
		X : array-like or generator, shape (n_samples, n_nodes)
			The data to fit the structure too, where each row is a sample and
			each column corresponds to the associated variable.

		weights : array-like, shape (n_samples), optional
			The weight of each sample as a positive double. Default is None.

		algorithm : str, one of 'chow-liu', 'greedy', 'exact', 'exact-dp' optional
			The algorithm to use for learning the Bayesian network. Default is
			'greedy' that greedily attempts to find the best structure, and
			frequently can identify the optimal structure. 'exact' uses DP/A*
			to find the optimal Bayesian network, and 'exact-dp' tries to find
			the shortest path on the entire order lattice, which is more memory
			and computationally expensive. 'exact' and 'exact-dp' should give
			identical results, with 'exact-dp' remaining an option mostly for
			debugging reasons. 'chow-liu' will return the optimal tree-like
			structure for the Bayesian network, which is a very fast
			approximation but not always the best network.

		max_parents : int, optional
			The maximum number of parents a node can have. If used, this means
			using the k-learn procedure. Can drastically speed up algorithms.
			If -1, no max on parents. Default is -1.

		penalty : float or None, optional
			The weighting of the model complexity term in the objective function.
			Increasing this value will encourage sparsity whereas setting the value
			to 0 will result in an unregularized structure. Default is
			log2(|D|) / 2 where |D| is the sum of the weights of the data.

		root : int, optional
			For algorithms which require a single root ('chow-liu'), this is the
			root for which all edges point away from. User may specify which
			column to use as the root. Default is the first column.

		constraint_graph : networkx.DiGraph or None, optional
			A directed graph showing valid parent sets for each variable. Each
			node is a set of variables, and edges represent which variables can
			be valid parents of those variables. The naive structure learning
			task is just all variables in a single node with a self edge,
			meaning that you know nothing about

		include_edges : list or None, optional
			A list of (parent, child) tuples that are edges which must be 
			present in the found structure. Default is None.

		exclude_edges : list or None, optional
			A list of (parent, child) tuples that are edges which cannot be
			present in the found structure. Default is None.

		pseudocount : double, optional
			A pseudocount to add to the emission of each distribution. This
			effectively smoothes the states to prevent 0. probability symbols
			if they don't happen to occur in the data. Default is 0.

		state_names : array-like, shape (n_nodes), optional
			A list of meaningful names to be applied to nodes

		name : str, optional
			The name of the model. Default is None.

		reduce_dataset : bool, optional
			Given the discrete nature of these datasets, frequently a user
			will pass in a dataset that has many identical samples. It is time
			consuming to go through these redundant samples and a far more
			efficient use of time to simply calculate a new dataset comprised
			of the subset of unique observed samples weighted by the number of
			times they occur in the dataset. This typically will speed up all
			algorithms, including when using a constraint graph. Default is
			True.

		keys : list
			A list of sets where each set is the keys present in that column.
			If there are d columns in the data set then this list should have
			d sets and each set should have at least two keys in it.

		n_jobs : int, optional
			The number of threads to use when learning the structure of the
			network. If a constraint graph is provided, this will parallelize
			the tasks as directed by the constraint graph. If one is not
			provided it will parallelize the building of the parent graphs.
			Both cases will provide large speed gains.

		Returns
		-------
		model : BayesianNetwork
			The learned BayesianNetwork.

cdef class ParentGraph(object):
	"""
	Generate a parent graph for a single variable over its parents.

	This will generate the parent graph for a single parents given the data.
	A parent graph is the dynamically generated best parent set and respective
	score for each combination of parent variables. For example, if we are
	generating a parent graph for x1 over x2, x3, and x4, we may calculate that
	having x2 as a parent is better than x2,x3 and so store the value
	of x2 in the node for x2,x3.

	Parameters
	----------
	X : numpy.ndarray, shape=(n, d)
		The data to fit the structure too, where each row is a sample and
		each column corresponds to the associated variable.

	weights : numpy.ndarray, shape=(n,)
		The weight of each sample as a positive double. Default is None.

	key_count : numpy.ndarray, shape=(d,)
		The number of unique keys in each column.

	include_parents : tuple
		A set of parents that this node must have.

	exclude_parents : tuple
		A set of parents that this node cannot have.

	pseudocount : double
		A pseudocount to add to each possibility.

	penalty : float or None, optional
		The weighting of the model complexity term in the objective function.
		Increasing this value will encourage sparsity whereas setting the value
		to 0 will result in an unregularized structure. Default is
		log2(|D|) / 2 where |D| is the sum of the weights of the data.

	max_parents : int
		The maximum number of parents a node can have. If used, this means
		using the k-learn procedure. Can drastically speed up algorithms.
		If -1, no max on parents. Default is -1.

	parent_set : tuple, default ()
		The variables which are possible parents for this variable. If nothing
		is passed in then it defaults to all other variables, as one would
		expect in the naive case. This allows for cases where we want to build
		a parent graph over only a subset of the variables.

	Returns
	-------

	removing the offending edges there are efficiencies that can be gained
	by considering the structure. In particular, parents not coming from the
	main node do not need to be considered in the order graph but simply
	added to each entry after creation of the order graph. This is because
	those variables occur earlier in the topological ordering but it doesn't
	matter how they occur otherwise. Parent graphs must be defined over all
	variables however.

	Parameters
	----------
	X : numpy.ndarray, shape=(n, d)
		The data to fit the structure too, where each row is a sample and
		each column corresponds to the associated variable.

	weights : numpy.ndarray, shape=(n,)
		The weight of each sample as a positive double. Default is None.

	key_count : numpy.ndarray, shape=(d,)
		The number of unique keys in each column.

	include_edges : list or None
		A list of (parent, child) tuples where each tuple corresponds to an
		edge that must exist in the found structure.

	exclude_edges : list or None
		A list of (parent, child) tuples where each tuple corresponds to an
		edge that cannot exist in the found structure.

	pseudocount : double
		A pseudocount to add to each possibility.

	penalty : float or None, optional
		The weighting of the model complexity term in the objective function.
		Increasing this value will encourage sparsity whereas setting the value
		to 0 will result in an unregularized structure. Default is
		log2(|D|) / 2 where |D| is the sum of the weights of the data.

	max_parents : int
		The maximum number of parents a node can have. If used, this means
		using the k-learn procedure. Can drastically speed up algorithms.
		If -1, no max on parents. Default is -1.

	n_jobs : int
		The number of threads to use when learning the structure of the
		network. This parallelizes the creation of the parent graphs.

	Returns
	-------
	structure : tuple, shape=(d,)
		The parents for each variable in this SCC

	"""
	Generate a parent graph for a single variable over its parents.

	This will generate the parent graph for a single parents given the data.
	A parent graph is the dynamically generated best parent set and respective
	score for each combination of parent variables. For example, if we are
	generating a parent graph for x1 over x2, x3, and x4, we may calculate that
	having x2 as a parent is better than x2,x3 and so store the value
	of x2 in the node for x2,x3.

	Parameters
	----------
	X : numpy.ndarray, shape=(n, d)
		The data to fit the structure too, where each row is a sample and
		each column corresponds to the associated variable.

	weights : numpy.ndarray, shape=(n,)
		The weight of each sample as a positive double. Default is None.

	key_count : numpy.ndarray, shape=(d,)
		The number of unique keys in each column.

	i : int
		The column index to build the parent graph for.

	include_edges : list or None
		A list of (parent, child) tuples where each tuple corresponds to an
		edge that must exist in the found structure.

	exclude_edges : list or None
		A list of (parent, child) tuples where each tuple corresponds to an
		edge that cannot exist in the found structure.

	pseudocount : double
		A pseudocount to add to each possibility.

	penalty : float or None, optional
		The weighting of the model complexity term in the objective function.
		Increasing this value will encourage sparsity whereas setting the value
		to 0 will result in an unregularized structure. Default is

	max_parents : int
		The maximum number of parents a node can have. If used, this means
		using the k-learn procedure. Can drastically speed up algorithms.
		If -1, no max on parents. Default is -1.

	parent_set : tuple, default ()
		The variables which are possible parents for this variable. If nothing
		is passed in then it defaults to all other variables, as one would
		expect in the naive case. This allows for cases where we want to build
		a parent graph over only a subset of the variables.
