	This function takes in a SparseHMM object and sets of edges and adds the
	edges to the model. It is designed to allow the model to be initialized
	either through passing in the edges initially or created through the
	`add_edge` API. Doing this is slightly more complicated than in the
	DenseHMM case because we use an underlying sparse representation to store
	the edges and so cannot as easily simply modify a random element in each
	call to `add_edge`.

class SparseHMM(_BaseHMM):
	"""A hidden Markov model with a sparse transition matrix.

	A hidden Markov model is an extension of a mixture model to sequences by
	including a transition matrix between the elements of the mixture. Each of
	the algorithms for a hidden Markov model are essentially just a revision
	of those algorithms to incorporate this transition matrix.

	This object is a wrapper for a hidden Markov model with a sparse transition
	matrix.

	Separately, there are two ways to instantiate the hidden Markov model. The
	first is by passing in a set of distributions, a dense transition matrix, 
	and optionally start/end probabilities. The second is to initialize the
	object without these and then to add edges using the `add_edge` method
	and to add distributions using the `add_distributions` method. Importantly, 
	the way that you choose to initialize the hidden Markov model is independent of the
	implementation that you end up choosing. If you pass in a dense transition
	matrix, this will be converted to a sparse matrix with all the zeros
	dropped if you choose `kind='sparse'`.


	Parameters
	----------
	distributions: tuple or list
		A set of distribution objects. These objects do not need to be
		initialized, i.e., can be "Normal()". 

	edges: numpy.ndarray, torch.Tensor, or None. shape=(k,k)
		A dense transition matrix of probabilities for how each node or
		distribution passed in connects to each other one. This can contain
		many zeroes, and when paired with `kind='sparse'`, will drop those
		elements from the matrix.

	starts: list, numpy.ndarray, torch.Tensor, or None. shape=(k,)
		The probability of starting at each node. If not provided, assumes
		these probabilities are uniform.

	ends: list, numpy.ndarray, torch.Tensor, or None. shape=(k,)
		The probability of ending at each node. If not provided, assumes
		these probabilities are uniform.

	inertia: float, [0, 1], optional
		Indicates the proportion of the update to apply to the parameters
		during training. When the inertia is 0.0, the update is applied in
		its entirety and the previous parameters are ignored. When the
		inertia is 1.0, the update is entirely ignored and the previous
		parameters are kept, equivalently to if the parameters were frozen.

	frozen: bool, optional
		Whether all the parameters associated with this distribution are frozen.
		If you want to freeze individual pameters, or individual values in those
		parameters, you must modify the `frozen` attribute of the tensor or
		parameter directly. Default is False.

	check_data: bool, optional
		Whether to check properties of the data and potentially recast it to
		torch.tensors. This does not prevent checking of parameters but can
		slightly speed up computation when you know that your inputs are valid.
		Setting this to False is also necessary for compiling.
