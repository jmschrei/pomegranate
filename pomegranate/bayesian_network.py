class BayesianNetwork(Distribution):
	"""A Bayesian network object.

	A Bayesian network is a probability distribution where dependencies between
	variables are explicitly encoded in a graph structure and the lack of an
	edge represents a conditional independence. These graphs are directed and
	typically must be acyclic, but this implementation allows for the networks
	to be cyclic as long as there is no assumption of convergence during
	inference.

	Inference is doing using loopy belief propogation along a factor graph
	representation. This is sometimes called the `sum-product` algorithm.
	It will yield exact results if the graph has a tree-like structure.
	Otherwise, if the graph is acyclic, it is guaranteed to converge but not
	necessarily to optimal results. If the graph is cyclic, there is no
	guarantee on convergence, but it is thought that the longer the loop is the 
	more likely one will get good results.

	Structure learning can be done using a variety of methods. 


	Parameters
	----------
	distributions: tuple or list or None
		A set of distribution objects. These do not need to be initialized,
		i.e. can be "Categorical()". Currently, they must be either Categorical
		or JointCategorical distributions. If provided, they must be consistent
		with the provided edges in that every conditional distribution must
		have at least one parent in the provided structure. Default is None.

	edges: tuple or list or None, optional
		A list or tuple of 2-tuples where the first element in the 2-tuple is 
		the parent distribution object and the second element is the child
		distribution object. If None, then no edges. Default is None.

	struture: tuple or list or None, optional
		A list or tuple of the parents for each distribution with a tuple
		containing no elements indicating a root node. For instance, 
		((), (0,), (), (0, 2)) would represent a graph with four nodes, 
		where the second distribution has the first distribution as a parent 
		and the fourth distribution has the first and third distributions as 
		parents. Use this only when you want new distribution objects to be
		created and fit when using the `fit` method. Default is None.

	max_iter: int, optional
		The number of iterations to do in the inference step. Default is 10.

	tol: float, optional
		The threshold at which to stop during fitting when the improvement
		goes under. Default is 1e-6.

	inertia: float, [0, 1], optional
		Indicates the proportion of the update to apply to the parameters
		during fitting. When the inertia is 0.0, the update is applied in
		its entirety and the previous parameters are ignored. When the
		inertia is 1.0, the update is entirely ignored and the previous
		parameters are kept, equivalently to if the parameters were frozen.

	frozen: bool, optional
		Whether all the parameters associated with this distribution are frozen.
		If you want to freeze individual pameters, or individual values in those
		parameters, you must modify the `frozen` attribute of the tensor or
		parameter directly. Default is False.

	check_data: bool, optional
		Whether to check properties of the data and potentially recast it to
		torch.tensors. This does not prevent checking of parameters but can
		slightly speed up computation when you know that your inputs are valid.
		Setting this to False is also necessary for compiling. Default is True.

	verbose: bool, optional
		Whether to print the improvement and timings during training.

	"""Find the optimal graph over a set of variables with no other knowledge.
	
	This is the naive dynamic programming structure learning task where the
	optimal graph is identified from a set of variables using an order graph
	and parent graphs. This can be used either when no constraint graph is
	provided or for a SCC which is made up of a node containing a self-loop.
	This is a reference implementation that uses the naive shortest path
	algorithm over the entire order graph. The 'exact' option uses the A* path
	in order to avoid considering the full order graph.
	

	Parameters
	----------
	X: numpy.ndarray, shape=(n, d)
		The data to fit the structure too, where each row is a sample and
		each column corresponds to the associated variable.
	
	sample_weight: numpy.ndarray, shape=(n,)
		The weight of each sample as a positive double. Default is None.
	
	include_parents: list or None
		A set of (parent, child) tuples where each tuple is an edge that
		must exist in the found structure.
	
	exclude_parents: list or None
		A set of (parent, child) tuples where each tuple is an edge that
		cannot exist in the found structure.
	
	penalty: float or None, optional
		The weighting of the model complexity term in the objective function.
		Increasing this value will encourage sparsity whereas setting the value
		to 0 will result in an unregularized structure. Default is
		log2(|D|) / 2 where |D| is the sum of the weights of the data.
	
	max_parents: int
		The maximum number of parents a node can have. If used, this means
		using the k-learn procedure. Can drastically speed up algorithms.
		If -1, no max on parents. Default is -1.
		

	Returns
	-------
	structure: tuple, shape=(d,)
